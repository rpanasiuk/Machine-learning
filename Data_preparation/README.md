# Food choices and preferences of college students

This dataset includes information on food choices, nutrition, preferences, childhood favorites, and other information from college students. There are 125 responses from students. Data is raw and uncleaned. Data comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/borapajo/food-choices/data).

#### Dataset was created to take a look at student's nutrition habits:
- What does influence on students cooking frequency?
- Are students who are active in sports put more attention to nutritional check than the others?
- Are kids and parents have similar cooking habits?
- Is there any correlation between types of world cuisines that students like or do not like? 
In this notebook we will visualize some of these features and try find any connections.
#### **The main goals:**
    - Data exploration/some cleaning.
    - Data analysis.
    - Visualization.
