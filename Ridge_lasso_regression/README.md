# Machine learning - ridge and lasso regression

In this small project, we will compare two powerful regression techniques with two different penalazing the magnitude of the coefficients methods.<br>
1. **Ridge Regression:**<br>
    - using L2 regularization, adds penalty equivalent to square of magnitude of coefficients
    - keep trade-off balance between the RSS and magnitude of the coefficients<br>
    - minimalize total cost<br>
    <br>
2. **Lasso Regression:**<br>
    - using L1 regularization, adds penalty equivalent to absolute value of magnitude of coefficients<br>
    - keep trade-off balance between the RSS and magnitude of the coefficients<br>
    - minimalize total cost<br>
