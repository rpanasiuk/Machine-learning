## Machine learning

- ### Micro-projects:

	- [Ridge and lasso regression](https://github.com/rpanasiuk/portfolio/blob/master/Ridge_lasso_regression/Ridge_lasso_regression.ipynb): Quick comparison of two powerful regression techniques and exploring impact of tuning parameters on final results.
	- [Lasso regression](https://github.com/rpanasiuk/portfolio/blob/master/Lasso_regression/lasso_regression_task.ipynb): 
	The main task is to investigate tuning parameter impact on the RSS and magnitude of coefficients using wide range of penalty values. Task idea and dataset comes from coursera's machine learning course (one of the quiz sections). 
	- [Decision tree](https://github.com/rpanasiuk/portfolio/blob/master/Decision_tree/class_project.ipynb): 
	Playing with dataset which comes from coursera's machine learning specialization. The main task is to build a model to predict what is probability to pay back a loan.
  
- ### In progress:

	- [Food choices and preferences of college students](https://github.com/rpanasiuk/portfolio/blob/master/Data_preparation/Food_choice.ipynb): This dataset includes information on food choices, nutrition, preferences, childhood favorites, and other information from college students.
    <br>**The main goals**:
      - Data exploration/engineering/cleaning.
      - Select and traing a ML model.
      - Parameters optimization.
      - Evaluation.
