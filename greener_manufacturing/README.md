# Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing

Dataset represents different permutations of Mercedes-Benz car features.
    <br>**The main goals**:
      - Data preparation/exploration.
      - Deeper insight into data.
      - Build a model.<br>
      
I am following a workflow based on kaggle's kernels implemented in R language.<br>
I add some of my own ideas during data preparation/insight process.<br>
The next goal on todo list is building a model using OOP and stacking approaches.
